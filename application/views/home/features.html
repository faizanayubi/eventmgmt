                        Four payment processors available to make the online payment transactions more comfortable, Organizer can choose the preferred option from the available. Create as many tickets as you wish to offer. Free tickets, paid tickets, all are welcome. Set your own sale periods (good for offering earlyâ€“bird tickets). Limit the quantity on sale or let them run wild. Require slab based pricing for bulk ticket purchases? DoAttend has that covered too. Discounts are just as powerful as tickets. Create multiple discount coupons, configure them as percentages or absolute amounts and set their validity period.
